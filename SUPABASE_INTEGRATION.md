# Supabase Integration Setup

## Configuration

The Supabase client is already configured with your project credentials:
- **URL**: `https://bsguvhudffrxjvcpxnte.supabase.co`
- **Anon Key**: Already configured in `client/src/helper/supabase.ts`

## Database Schema

The component expects a table named `authorized_users` with the following columns:

- `unique_id` (text, primary key) - Student/Staff ID
- `user_name` (text) - Full name
- `vehicle_number` (text, nullable) - Vehicle registration number
- `Department` (text) - Department name
- `User_Type` (text) - Either 'Student' or 'Staff'
- `is_active` (boolean) - Active status
- `created_at` (timestamp) - Creation timestamp

## Enhanced Database Functions

The helper file includes additional functions for access control:

- `getAuthorizedUsers()` - Get all active users
- `getUserById(uniqueId)` - Find user by ID
- `getUserByVehicle(vehicleNumber)` - Find user by vehicle
- `createAccessLog(logData)` - Log access attempts
- `getAccessLogs(limit, offset)` - Get paginated access logs
- `getRecentAccessLogs()` - Get last 24 hours of logs
- `getAccessStats()` - Get today's access statistics
