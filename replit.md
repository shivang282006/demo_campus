# Campus Gate Access Control System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive campus vehicle access control system built with a full-stack TypeScript architecture. The application manages student vehicle entry/exit through automated gate systems using license plate recognition and student ID barcode scanning. It provides real-time monitoring, access logging, alert management, and student database administration for campus security.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Tooling**
- React with TypeScript for type-safe UI development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching

**UI Component System**
- shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- Support for light/dark mode themes
- Component variants managed through class-variance-authority

**Real-Time Communication**
- WebSocket connection for live updates (access logs, alerts, verification status)
- Custom `useWebSocket` hook for connection management and automatic reconnection
- Real-time dashboard updates triggered by WebSocket messages

**Key Features**
- Dashboard with live statistics (total access, granted/denied counts, active gates)
- Camera station interface for license plate and barcode scanning
- Student management with search, filtering, and CRUD operations
- Access log viewing with real-time updates
- Alert system for unauthorized access and system events

**Design Patterns**
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (webcam access, WebSocket, toast notifications)
- Query invalidation strategy for cache synchronization
- Separation of concerns with dedicated component files

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- Express.js for HTTP API and middleware handling
- Native HTTP server upgraded with WebSocket support
- Session-based request logging with JSON response capture

**API Design**
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Dedicated routes for dashboard stats, student search, vehicle verification
- WebSocket broadcasting for real-time client updates
- Middleware for request/response logging and JSON parsing

**Development Setup**
- Vite integration in middleware mode for HMR during development
- Production build separates client bundle and server bundle
- Custom error handling and logging utilities

### Data Storage

**Database**
- PostgreSQL as the primary database (via Neon serverless)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Schema-first approach with TypeScript types generated from Drizzle schemas

**Schema Design**
- **Students table**: Core student information (ID, name, department, year, contact, photo)
- **Vehicles table**: Vehicle registration linked to students (plate number, type, model, color)
- **Access logs table**: Entry/exit records with timestamps and status (granted/denied)
- **Alerts table**: Security alerts with severity levels and metadata

**Data Relationships**
- One-to-many: Student â†’ Vehicles
- Foreign key references ensure data integrity
- Soft deletion support via `isActive` flags

**Query Patterns**
- Complex joins for access logs with student and vehicle details
- Search with multiple filters (department, year, query string)
- Real-time stats aggregation for dashboard
- Verification queries combining student and vehicle validation
